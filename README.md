## The Process :triangular_ruler:

My goal for this project was to create a clean, minimal and modern portfolio page. This site was created using my adquired skills Le Wagon Tokyo coding Bootcamp, but also challenging myself and learning-applying new things. 

Most of my design choices were made after compiling a small check list on paper, and Trello, to make sure I kept to my original plan and was fulfilling the outcomes I had set for the project.

Due to my design being image heavy, I decided to use [Optimizilla](http://optimizilla.com/) to create optimised, minified copies of my images which drastically decreased load time.

## The Design :pencil2:

My favourite example of engaging, clean web design at the moment is https://stripe.com, so naturally when given the task of revamping my own website, I took a lot of inspiration from [Benjamin de Cock's](https://dribbble.com/bdc) designs.

Two of my biggest shifts in design were using an animated colour gradient for backgrounds and condensing my introduction blurb translations into one flippable card. I used [David Walsh's CSS Flip](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip) guide and [Ian Forrest's Gradient Animator](https://www.gradient-animator.com/) to bring these ideas to fruition.


[Start Bootstrap's Freelancer Theme](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/) was also crucial in determining my initial layout.

## The Projects :art:

The bulk of my projects section is made up of web application I made at Le Wagon Tokyo.
